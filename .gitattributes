# Normalize line endings for a cross-platform web project
# Store LF in the repository and use LF in working tree for text files,
# but keep CRLF for Windows batch scripts.

# Default: treat all files as text and enforce LF line endings
* text=auto eol=lf

# Windows scripts keep CRLF
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf

# Shell/posix scripts (if any)
*.sh text eol=lf
*.ps1 text eol=lf

# Images and other binaries stay untouched
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jpeg binary
*.gif binary
*.ico binary
